            An empty space,<br />
            With a window offering a view<br />
            A bird, sitting outside on a plain wall<br />
            A patch of green grass <br />
            Some unrecognized sounds and voices<br />
            A little breeze<br />
            Somebody laughing,<br />
            Somebody singing inside their homes<br />
            The Bird flies away <br />
        </p>
        <p id="content2" class="hidden">
            Making the moss more visible in its absence<br />
            A mobile phone is ringing at the neighbours'<br />
            Somebody is talking on the phone <br />
            The bird returns to its place with another tiny<br />
            Hops around with its partner <br />
            The sun shines more brightly now <br />
            You, gazing, staring, listening, thinking <br />
            Close to the window <br />
        </p>
        <p id="content3" class="hidden">
            On your chair <br />
            gazing ,staring ,listening ,thinking <br />
            Breathing deeply <br />
            Closing your eyes,when the gush of breeze meets your face <br />
            Looking for the bird now <br />
            How it passes its day <br />
            Simply flying to and fro <br />
            There are more ,you gaze upwards at the - <br />
            'Bluest sky' you thought was seen only when you were a child ! <br />
        </p>
        <p id="content4" class="hidden">

            The sun becomes dim now, for you, to see, what more the sky can do for you <br />
            How long you took, to sit and look around you<br />
            The sky that had always been the same <br />
            but you flew away like that bird that made that plain wall look more forlorn<br />
            But the bird, that little winged creature ,it knows the joys of returning soon <br />
            But you took 15 years <br />
            To just look back at the sky <br /><br />


            <b>And no wonder you had been thinking that blue was your favourite colour !</b><br />
